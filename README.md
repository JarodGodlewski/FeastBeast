### Usage:

Through my testing on chrome: the website will tell you that it is not secure when you first visit it.

To view the solution please click the advanced options pull down on that error page given by chrome and continue to the website anyway.

**Installation:**

In case the website is not up, the solution can be viewed by:

1. Moving the files from the master branch into the folder
2. Tranversing to the ui folder in your command line.
3. After you type these commands the website should pop up in your default browser:
  * npm install
  * npm instal -g bower
  * npm install -g bower
  * gulp spinup

**Description:**

This website was a submission for the coding challenege put out by CapitalOne for second round Software Engineering summit applicants this summer (2017).

The "FeastBeast" logo is play on the company Supreme's logo and how their followers are known as "HypeBeasts".

I made a swagger API on heroku to make my calls to the Yelp Fusion API; since the Yelp API did not allow direct calls to it's API from my JavaScript file.
