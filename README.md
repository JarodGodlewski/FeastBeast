### Usage:

Through my testing on chrome: the website will first tell you that it is not secure when you first visit it.

To view the solution please click the advanced options pull down on that error page given by chrome and continue to the website anyway.

**Installation:**

In case the website is not up, the solution can be viewed by:

1. Moving the files from the master branch into the folder
2. Tranversing to the ui folder in your command line.
3. After you type these commands the website should pop up in your default browser:
  * npm install
  * npm instal -g bower
  * npm install -g bower
  * gulp spinup

**Description:**
